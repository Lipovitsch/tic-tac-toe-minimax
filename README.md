# Tic Tac Toe with minimax algorithm
This is a simple tic tac toe game where user plays against computer. Computer uses minimax algorithm so it cannot be defeated.

Only pygame library is needed to be able to play.

To choose who starts the game there is user_starts parameter inside main() function. Initially user_starts is set to True.

Code need to be clean up and it will be soon.
